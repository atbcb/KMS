<h2>Chapter 1: Application and Administration</h2>
<h3 id="f101"><a name="F101 Purpose"></a>F101 Purpose</h3>
<p>This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities.&nbsp; The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, <cite title="An expansion, extension, or increase in the gross floor area or height of a building or facility.">addition</cite> to, <cite title="A change to a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or portion thereof.&nbsp; Alteration include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways, changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions.&nbsp; Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.">alteration</cite>, and lease of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (ABA).</p>
<h3 id="f102"><a name="F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children"></a>F102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</h3>
<p>The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="f103"><a name="F103 Modifications and Waivers"></a>F103 Modifications and Waivers</h3>
<p>The Architectural Barriers Act authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service to modify or waive the accessibility standards for buildings and facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act on a case-by-case basis, upon application made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States concerned.&nbsp; The General Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Defense, and the United States Postal Service may grant a modification or waiver only upon a determination that it is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Section 502(b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorizes the Access Board to ensure that modifications and waivers are based on findings of fact and are not inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<p class="advisory">Advisory F103 Modifications and Waivers.&nbsp; The provisions for modifications and waivers differ from the requirement issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act in that "equivalent facilitation" does not apply.&nbsp; There is a formal procedure for Federal agencies to request a waiver or modification of applicable standards under the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>
<h3 id="f104"><a name="F104 Conventions"></a>F104 Conventions</h3>
<p id="f1041">F104.1 Dimensions.&nbsp; Dimensions that are not stated as "maximum" or "minimum" are absolute.</p>
<p id="f10411">F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</p>
<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory F104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances.&nbsp; Conventional industry tolerances recognized by this provision include those for field conditions and those that may be a necessary consequence of a particular manufacturing process.&nbsp; Recognized tolerances are not intended to apply to design work.</p>
<p>It is good practice when specifying dimensions to avoid specifying a tolerance where dimensions are absolute.&nbsp; For example, if this document requires "1 inches," avoid specifying "1 inches plus or minus X inches."</p>
<p>Where the requirement states a specified range, such as in Section 609.4 where grab bars must be installed between 33 inches and 36 inches above the floor, the range provides an adequate tolerance and therefore no tolerance outside of the range at either end point is permitted.</p>
<p>Where a requirement is a minimum or a maximum dimension that does not have two specific minimum and maximum end points, tolerances may apply.&nbsp; Where an element is to be installed at the minimum or maximum permitted dimension, such as "15 inches minimum" or "5 pounds maximum", it would not be good practice to specify "5 pounds (plus X pounds) or 15 inches (minus X inches)." Rather, it would be good practice to specify a dimension less than the required maximum (or more than the required minimum) by the amount of the expected field or manufacturing tolerance and not to state any tolerance in conjunction with the specified dimension.</p>
<p class="last">Specifying dimensions in design in the manner described above will better ensure that facilities and elements accomplish the level of accessibility intended by these requirements.&nbsp; It will also more often produce an end result of strict and literal compliance with the stated requirements and eliminate enforcement difficulties and issues that might otherwise arise.&nbsp; Information on specific tolerances may be available from industry or trade organizations, code groups and building officials, and published references.</p>
</div>
<p id="f1042">F104.2 Calculation of Percentages.&nbsp; Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided.&nbsp; Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</p>

<p class="first">Advisory F240.2.1 Ground Level Play Components.&nbsp; Examples of ground level play components may include spring rockers, swings, diggers, and stand-alone slides.&nbsp; When distinguishing between the different types of ground level play components, consider the general experience provided by the play component.&nbsp; Examples of different types of experiences include, but are not limited to, rocking, swinging, climbing, spinning, and sliding.&nbsp; A spiral slide may provide a slightly different experience from a straight slide, but sliding is the general experience and therefore a spiral slide is not considered a different type of play component from a straight slide.</p>
<p>Ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities must be integrated into the play area.&nbsp; Designers should consider the optimal layout of ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities to foster interaction and socialization among all children. Grouping all ground level play components accessed by children with disabilities in one location is not considered integrated.</p>

<p>Ramps are preferred over transfer systems since not all children who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices may be able to use, or may choose not to use, transfer systems.</p>
<p>Where ramps connect elevated play components, the maximum rise of any ramp run is limited to 12 inches (305 mm). Where possible, designers and operators are encouraged to provide ramps with a slope less than the 1:12 maximum. Berms or sculpted dirt may be used to provide elevation and may be part of an <cite title="A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with this part.">accessible</cite> route to composite play structures.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 302.1 General.&nbsp; A stable surface is one that remains unchanged by contaminants or applied force, so that when the contaminant or force is removed, the surface returns to its original condition.&nbsp; A firm surface resists deformation by either indentations or particles moving on its surface.&nbsp; A slip-resistant surface provides sufficient frictional counterforce to the forces exerted in walking to permit safe ambulation.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 302.2 Carpet.&nbsp; Carpets and permanently affixed mats can significantly increase the amount of force (roll resistance) needed to propel a wheelchair over a surface. The firmer the carpeting and backing, the lower the roll resistance.&nbsp; A pile thickness up to ½ inch (13 mm) (measured to the backing, cushion, or pad) is allowed, although a lower pile provides easier wheelchair maneuvering.&nbsp; If a backing, cushion or pad is used, it must be firm.&nbsp; Preferably, carpet pad should not be used because the soft padding increases roll resistance.</p>

<div class="advisory">
<p class="first">Advisory 706.1 General.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems are generally categorized by their mode of transmission.&nbsp; There are hard-wired systems and three types of wireless systems: induction loop, infrared, and FM radio transmission.&nbsp; Each has different advantages and disadvantages that can help determine which system is best for a given application.&nbsp; For example, an FM system may be better than an infrared system in some open-air assemblies since infrared signals are less effective in sunlight.&nbsp; On the other hand, an infrared system is typically a better choice than an FM system where confidential transmission is important because it will be contained within a given space.</p>
<p>The technical standards for assistive listening systems describe minimum performance levels for volume, interference, and distortion.&nbsp; Sound pressure levels (SPL), expressed in decibels, measure output sound volume.&nbsp; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N), also expressed in decibels, represents the relationship between the loudness of a desired sound (the signal) and the background noise in a space or piece of equipment.&nbsp; The higher the SNR, the more intelligible the signal.&nbsp; The peak clipping level limits the distortion in signal output produced when high-volume sound waves are manipulated to serve assistive listening devices.</p>
<p class="last">Selecting or specifying an effective assistive listening system for a large or complex venue requires assistance from a professional sound engineer.&nbsp; The Access Board has published technical assistance&nbsp;on assistive listening devices and systems.</p>

<p class="advisory">Advisory 706.3 Receiver Hearing-Aid Compatibility.&nbsp; Neckloops and headsets that can be worn as neckloops are compatible with hearing aids. Receivers that are not compatible include earbuds, which may require removal of hearing aids, earphones, and headsets that must be worn over the ear, which can create disruptive interference in the transmission and can be uncomfortable for people wearing hearing aids.</p>
<p id="a7064">706.4 Sound Pressure Level.&nbsp; Assistive listening systems shall be capable of providing a sound pressure level of 110 dB minimum and 118 dB maximum with a dynamic range on the volume control of 50 dB.</p>
