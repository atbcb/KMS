Moveable elements and furnishings are generally not addressed or covered by the ADA Standards.  DOJ’s ADA regulations include requirements that may impact non-fixed elements, such as providing accessible medical equipment, including examination tables and chairs, to provide persons with disabilities effective access to health services.  In addition, placement of non-fixed elements can affect the accessibility of an area by encroaching into accessible routes and clearances.  [See DOJ’s regulations:  35.15.1(d) and 36.406(b)].\nUnless specifically permitted, access features required by the ADA Standards must be fixed or built-in even though portable alternatives may be available.  This includes requirements for assistive listening systems, visual alarms, shower seats, ramps, and platform lifts.  (In removing barriers to existing places of public accommodation, portable solutions may be permitted in some cases where permanent solutions are not readily achievable). ",

This determination is left to other building requirements or regulations, good practice, client preference, or other factors.  The provisions covering elements designed for children’s use (other than those addressing play areas) are structured as exceptions to specifications based on adult dimensions.  Once the decision is made to design certain elements based on children’s dimensions and to use the exceptions, the alternate specifications provided in the ADA Standards must be followed.  The ADA Standards do not require provision of additional accessible elements in order to separately accommodate both children and adults, although doing so may be advisable in mixed use spaces.  For example, in some restrooms at facilities such as schools and children’s museums, it may be a good idea to provide a wheelchair accessible toilet compartment for use by adults and another for use by children.",

         "content": "The ADA Standards allow alternatives to specified requirements that provide substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability as an “equivalent facilitation.” The question of whether an alternative solution is “equivalent” involves considerations as to whether it is just as, if not more, effective in terms of accessibility, usability, convenience, and reliability for people with disabilities. For example, the ADA Standards specify permanent or built-in features for independent access. Unless otherwise specified, alternatives involving temporary or portable solutions or requiring assistance from others are not generally deemed equivalent to the required minimum level of access.<br><br>The provision of equivalent facilitation is intended to accommodate good faith innovations and technological advances not anticipated by the ADA Standards. It is not to be used as a means to resolve oversights in design or construction. Understanding the rationale for certain specifications is often helpful in determining whether an alternative is equivalent. For example, transfer shower stalls are required to be 36 inches by 36 inches absolute so that grab bars remain within reach from the seat. A wider transfer shower stall would not qualify as “equivalent facilitation” because it would make the grab bars less usable from the seat and less accessible to individuals with disabilities.<br><br>DOT’s ADA regulations (§37.9) detail the process, procedures and requirements for seeking a determination of equivalent facilitation for a public transportation facility subject to DOT’s ADA Standards. No departures from specific provisions of the DOT standards can be made without a determination issued by the Administrator of the relevant operating administration (e.g., the Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, or the Federal Highway Administration) with the concurrence of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy. Requests for official determinations of equivalent facilitation should be directed to the Federal Transit Administration.<br><br>DOJ’s ADA regulations do not establish a process for approving or certifying equivalent facilitation alternatives to requirements of DOJ’s ADA Standards. In the case of DOJ’s ADA Standards, the responsibility for demonstrating equivalent facilitation in the event of a legal challenge or complaint rests with the covered entity. In pursuing equivalent facilitation alternatives under DOJ’s ADA regulations, it is good practice to: <br><br><ul><li>base decisions on sound independent research and reliable data </li><li>involve disability groups and individuals with a variety of disabilities in the process </li><li>document the effort thoroughly, including information and feedback from consulted sources</li></ul>",

Besides car size, provisions for LULAs differ from those of §407 in that:<br><br><ul><li>Hoistway doors can be swinging type (they must open and close automatically, be power-operated, meet requirements for doors and referenced ANSI/BHMA Standards for low-energy doors, and remain open for at least 20 seconds)</li><li>Requirements are not included for door timing and delay or for car position indicators</li></ul>",

However, the standards do not specify a minimum level of slip resistance (coefficient of friction) because a consensus method for rating slip resistance remains elusive.  While different measurement devices and protocols have been developed over the years for use in the laboratory or the field, a widely accepted method has not emerged.  Since rating systems are unique to the test method, specific levels of slip resistance can only be meaningfully specified according to a particular measurement protocol.  Some flooring products are labeled with a slip resistance rating based on a laboratory test procedure.<br><br>Compliance with the standards requires specifying surface materials, textures, or finishes that prevent or minimize slipperiness under the conditions likely to be found on the surface.  Standard practices for minimizing floor or ground slipperiness will likely satisfy compliance with the standards as slip resistance is important not just for accessibility but for general safety as well.  Applications and finishes used to increase a surface material’s slip resistance may require continued maintenance or re-application.",

Notes:  Recommendations:  Provide access to a reasonable number of spaces serving EV charging stations or use the scoping table in §208.2 to determine an appropriate number.  (The number of accessible spaces serving EV charging stations must be determined separately from the required number of car and van parking spaces.)  Provide an accessible route on both sides of the vehicle space that connects to the charging station for easier access.  A vehicle space at least 10’ – 13’ wide is advisable.  A 10’ width offers an extra 2’ that effectively provides a 5’ aisle on one side when paired with the accessible route; a 13’ wide space will allow an 8’ aisle. This flexibility is helpful since the parking direction is determined by the location of the charging station and the vehicle connection.  Use the International Symbol of Accessibility only where spaces are reserved exclusively for people with disabilities.  "

         "answer": "The ADA charges the Access Board with the responsibility of developing guidelines for accessible design that are intended to serve as the basis for mandatory and enforceable ADA Standards adopted by DOJ and DOT. The ADA Standards and the Board's guidelines are developed and adopted using the procedures that apply to the federal rulemaking process. Under this process, agencies publish proposed language in the Federal Register, and then provide the public with the opportunity to provide input during a specified comment period. Often, agencies also hold public hearings during the comment period. Prior to publication of the final rule, agencies must review the public comments they have received. They also must assess the costs and benefits of the new guidelines or standards on the public, including their impact on small businesses. The same process must be followed for changes and updates to the guidelines and standards.",

As defined in the Standards, a \"story\" contains space for \"human occupancy\" (i.e., equipped with ventilation, light, and means of egress). Levels of open parking structures that do not contain occupiable space are not considered \"stories\" under the Standards. However, an accessible route must connect all accessible parking spaces to the accessible entrances they serve as well as any other elements or spaces required to be accessible. Vertical access must be provided as necessary to address any changes in level along these required accessible routes. For example, in underground parking garages, elevators or, where feasible, pedestrian ramps, are necessary to provide an accessible route from parking levels with accessible spaces to the facility they serve.",

If RV or trailer spaces are located in parking facilities with car and van parking spaces, scoping should be applied separately to both types which will permit accessible RV or trailer spaces to be located among other RV or trailer spaces so long as they are on the shortest accessible route to facility entrances among such spaces. Access aisles serving accessible spaces must be as long as the vehicle space they serve.<br><br>The ABA Standards, which apply to federally funded sites, provide requirements for outdoor developed areas on federal lands such as camping and picnic facilities that include provisions for RV parking and pull-up spaces.  They can be consulted as a reference in addressing access to RV parking on non-federal sites, including those subject to the ADA.  The ABA Standards address access to RV and other parking spaces at camping and picnic units and pull-up spaces at dump stations and cover space width (minimum 20’, or 16’ in the case of a second adjoining space) and utility and sewage hook-ups (§1011 and §1012).",

This applies where parking spaces are provided on the same site as the valet parking service. However, if valet parking service is provided on a site without any parking spaces, accessible parking spaces are not required on the site (but policies and practices to accommodate people with disabilities must be in place under the Department of Justice's ADA regulations). Public garages and other parking facilities subject to the Standards must comply and provide accessible parking spaces in any case. If a parking garage does not provide valet parking, or if valet parking service is provided off site by a different entity that parks vehicles in the garage, an accessible passenger loading zone is not required at the garage.",

For example, at an airport, passenger drop-off and pick-up areas serving cars, taxis, limousines, vans, and other vehicles are treated as passenger loading zones, while stops exclusively serving public transit buses, hotel buses, and other types of buses providing designated or specified public transportation must meet criteria for bus loading zones.",

         "answer": "In some cases, it may be unclear whether water closets enclosed by full height partitions are to be treated as toilet compartments or single-user toilet rooms under the Standards. Toilet compartments can have full-height partitions. The determination typically is based on whether the toilet compartment is located within a restroom/ bathing facility or if it is entered directly from a common use corridor or exterior route. Those located within a room (such as a men's room, women's room, or gender neutral multi-user restroom, locker room, shower room) can be scoped as toilet compartments under the Standards: at least one wheelchair accessible and, if six or more water closets/urinals are provided, at least one ambulatory accessible compartment (§213.3.1). Those that directly connect to, or are separated by, a hallway, corridor, or exterior route, are scoped as single-user toilet rooms: all must comply except that where clustered, 50% of each use must comply (§<a href=\"#ada-213_2\" class=\"navSectionLink\">213.2</a>). If a toilet compartment contains more than one plumbing fixture (e.g., a lavatory), it must comply as a toilet room (§<a href=\"#ada-604_8\" class=\"navSectionLink\">604.8</a>).",

         "question": "In transient lodging facilities, can roll-in showers be provided in those accessible guest rooms not required to have them?",
         "answer": "A specified portion of accessible guest rooms in transient lodging facilities with over 50 guest rooms must have a roll-in shower with a folding seat (§224.2). This shower design is required for transient lodging facilities because it affords users the option to roll in or to transfer to a seat. To provide additional bathing options, the Standards specify transfer showers and/or bathtubs for the other guest rooms required to comply, which are referred to as \"Rooms Without Roll-in Showers\" (Table 224.2). Roll-in showers are not specified for these other guest rooms, but the Standards do permit alternatives to prescribed requirements that result in \"substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability\" under the provision for \"equivalent facilitation\" (§<a href=\"#ada-103\" class=\"navSectionLink\">103</a>). It is important that departures from the types of bathing fixtures specified for guest rooms (roll-in showers versus transfer showers or bathtubs) under equivalent facilitation provide people with disabilities an equal or greater level of choice. For example, like the required roll-in showers, any additional roll-in showers provided instead of a transfer shower or bathtub should be equipped with seats. Further, offering a choice of standard and alternate roll-in showers will also enhance options, as each has its own benefits; the alternate roll-in shower with a seat is similar to a transfer shower by providing a grab bar opposite the seat that is within reach, while the standard roll-in shower provides easier maneuvering into the shower because the entry is as wide as the compartment. Additionally, accessible guest rooms must be dispersed among the various classes of guest rooms and provide choices in amenities comparable to those afforded other guests (§<a href=\"#ada-224_5\" class=\"navSectionLink\">224.5</a>). If one type of bathing fixture is provided in a class of guest room, that same type of fixture should be provided in the accessible guest room in that class to ensure an equivalent level of choice in amenities.",

If a door has a closer but no latch, or a latch and no closer, no additional latch side clearance is required (although providing the clearance is helpful in maneuvering through doors with closers without latches).

         "answer": "Ramps without level landings at changes in direction typically will not meet the Standards due to resulting compound slopes. This includes most circular or curved ramps, unless the radius is large enough so that the cross slope is compliant and compound slopes are avoided. Otherwise, the curvature and slope result in uneven surfaces that makes wheelchair maneuvering difficult because not all wheels rest evenly on the surface.",

         "answer": "The ADA Standards do not require that curb ramps have side flares, but limit the slope (1:10 max.) where they are provided. Side flares are advisable where pedestrian traffic may cross runs to prevent tripping hazards. Side flares are essential in alterations when space for a top landing (36\" deep min.) is not available; in this instance, side flares (1:12 max. slope) are necessary to accommodate wheelchair maneuvering that will partially occur at flares in the absence of full landing space at the top unless a parallel-type curb ramp is provided.",

Transfer shower compartments always have a seat which is helpful to many people with disabilities, including those who are ambulatory. However, they do not provide any roll-in option for those who prefer not to transfer to a seat. Roll-in showers provide easier access for those who do not wish to transfer. However, many people need to transfer from wheelchairs to either a shower seat or shower chair. For these reasons, designs that afford users options are better, such as equipping all roll-in showers with folding seats. In facilities with multiple bathrooms or bathing facilities, it is generally advisable to provide different types of bathing fixtures to allow more options.",

Providing a second lavatory is generally not considered an issue under the ADA Standards, so long as the room has the required privacy latch.
